# Contana

Contana ([https://contana.fr](https://contana.fr)) is an accounting/ERP/CRM web application for managing business. It allows to manage several companies at the same time.

This repository contains the source code of the new version of Contana, which is currently under development. ( NOT READY FOR PRODUCTION ). The actual version of Contana is not open source.

Contana is a web application written using :

- [Vuejs 3](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Django 4.2](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the backend (API) / Python 3
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the frontend bundler

## Why a new version ?

The actual running version of Contana use almost the same technnologies as the new. But without using Typescript and Vite. The frontend was written in Vuejs 2.6 and the backend in Django 3.2. The frontend was bundled with Webpack. Which was a bit slow. Adding new features was becoming more and more boring due to the slowness. The new version of Contana is written in Vuejs 3 with typescript and Django 4.2. The frontend is bundled with Vite.
The goal of this new version is to make the application faster more reliable and easier to maintain, also to make it more user friendly/ergonomic. And also improve my skills.

## Goals

Actually I'm working on reimplementing the features of the actual version of Contana. The goal is to have a new version of Contana with the same features as the actual version but with a better UX and quicker/easier to use. Unhopefully I don't have a lot of time to work on this project. So it will take time to have a new version of Contana ready for production. But I'm working on it. Moreover the actual version of Contana is containing more than 135 000 lines of code. So it will take time to reimplement all the features.
Then I will add new features to Contana more concentrated on AI using language model to help making invoice or even invoice scanning.
