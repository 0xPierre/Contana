# Contana

Contana ([https://contana.fr](https://contana.fr)) is an accounting/ERP/CRM web application made for small to medium business. 
It allows to manage the invoicing and clients for several companies at the same time.

This repository contains the source code of the new version of Contana, which is currently under development.
Contana is a web application written using :

- [Vuejs 3](https://vuejs.org/) for the frontend
- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [Django 4.2](https://www.djangoproject.com/) for the backend (API) / Python 3
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) for the database
- [Celery](https://docs.celeryproject.org/en/stable/) for the background tasks
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) for the deployment
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for the frontend bundler

## Why a new version ?

An older version of Contana was running for several years.
Made in Vuejs 2 and Django 3.2, the performance of the application and the maintainability of the code were not optimal.
The goal of this new version is to make the application faster more reliable and easier to maintain, and also to make it more user friendly/ergonomic and to improve my skills.

## Goals

Currently I'm working with the time i have on reimplementing the features of the old version of Contana. The goal is to have a new version of Contana with the same features as the old version but with a better UX and quicker/easier to use. Unhopefully I don't have a lot of time to work on this project. So it will take time to have a new version of Contana ready for production. But I'm working on it. Moreover the old version of Contana is containing more than 135 000 lines of code. So it will take time to reimplement all the features.
Then I will add new features to Contana more concentrated on AI using language model to help making invoice or even invoice scanning.
